## Problem 1

``` r
# Load the dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

# Calculate the mean flipper length
mean_flipper_length <- penguins %>%
  pull(flipper_length_mm) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

Write a short description of the penguins dataset (not the penguins_raw
dataset) using inline R code. In your discussion, please include: - the
data in this dataset, including names / values of important variables -
the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol) - the mean flipper length

Answer: This dataset consists of 8 variables and they are: species,
island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g,
sex, and year (ncol=8). It contains 344 entries (nrow=344). It provides
us with information about different species of penguins (eg.Adelie,
Gentoo, and Chinastrap) and islands, their sex, year, as well as some
measurements of their weight, flipper length, bill length and bill
depth. From the dataset, we can also see there are some missing data, as
NA. The mean flipper length is 200.915 mm.

Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color
points using the species variable (adding color = … inside of aes in
your ggplot code should help). Export your first scatterplot to your
project directory using ggsave.

``` r
# Create a scatterplot
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Problem 2

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution a logical
vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 a
character vector of length 10 a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels” Try to take the mean of each variable in your
dataframe. What works and what doesn’t? Hint: to take the mean of a
variable in a dataframe, you need to pull the variable out of the
dataframe. Try loading the tidyverse and using the pull function.

``` r
# Create data frame
problem2_df = tibble (
  randomsample= rnorm(10),
  vec_char = c ("cancer", "recurrence", "demographics", "environment", "genetic", "age", "sex", "ethnicity", "comorbidity", "medication"),
  vec_logical= rnorm(10) > 0,
  vec_factor = factor(c("small", "medium", "large", "small", "small", "medium", "large", "small", "large", "medium"))
)

problem2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    randomsample vec_char     vec_logical vec_factor
    ##           <dbl> <chr>        <lgl>       <fct>     
    ##  1    -0.000800 cancer       TRUE        small     
    ##  2     1.14     recurrence   FALSE       medium    
    ##  3     1.90     demographics FALSE       large     
    ##  4     1.38     environment  TRUE        small     
    ##  5    -1.36     genetic      TRUE        small     
    ##  6     0.597    age          TRUE        medium    
    ##  7    -0.770    sex          TRUE        large     
    ##  8     1.13     ethnicity    FALSE       small     
    ##  9    -0.679    comorbidity  TRUE        large     
    ## 10     0.920    medication   TRUE        medium

``` r
# taking the mean of each variable
# a randomsample
randomsample <- problem2_df %>%
  pull(randomsample) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)

#vec_logical
mean_logical <- problem2_df %>%
  pull(vec_logical) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)


#vec_factor
mean_factor <- problem2_df %>%
  pull(vec_factor) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(., na.rm = TRUE): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

``` r
#vec_factor
mean_char <- problem2_df %>%
  pull(vec_char) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(., na.rm = TRUE): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

Answer: randomsample worked, it computed the average based on the
numeric inputs. vec_char and vec_factor: You cannot calculate the mean
of character or factor variables. If you attempt to calculate the mean
of these types, you will get an error.

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?

``` r
print(as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in print(as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_char)): NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
print(as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_logical))
```

    ##  [1] 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1

``` r
print(as.numeric(problem2_df$vec_factor))
```

    ##  [1] 3 2 1 3 3 2 1 3 1 2

What happened was when you convert a logical vector to numeric, the
values TRUE/FALSE are converted to 1 and 0 respectively. When you
convert a character vector to numeric, R cannot interpret the character
strings as numbers, so it replaces them with NA values and spit out a
warning: “NAs introduced by coercion.” When you convert a factor vector
to numeric, R returns the underlying integer codes that represent the
factor levels, not the actual level names. In this case, high, low,
medium are represented by 1, 2, 3. This happened because when you
convert a factor to numeric, R gives you the internal integer codes
representing the factor’s levels, which may not have any meaningful
interpretation in terms of the original factor labels. This does help
explain what happens when I’m try to take the mean. Essentially, the
mean of a factor converted to numeric is the average of the internal
integer codes of the factor levels. This value can be misleading or
meaningless because those numeric codes are simply R’s way of organizing
the factor levels—they don’t reflect actual numeric values of the
categories.
